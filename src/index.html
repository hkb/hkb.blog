<p>Hi, I'm Hans Kristian.</p>
<p>
    I'm a computer science drop-out accidentally turned tech entrepreneur and CEO. I'm building <a href="https://clerk.io">clerk.io</a>, <a href="https://workjoy.co">workjoy.co</a> and <a href="https://updatemate.ai">updatemate.ai</a> for fun and profit.
</p>
<p>
    I believe we entrepeneurs should share our learnings with each other. I learned my best startup lessons from <a href="/about">entrepreneurs that came before me</a>. This is my attempt to pass those learnings on to inspire you so you can avoid some of the mistakes I learned the hard way.
