# How to hire people that will actually be great at the job

Most people when they hire make one big mistake — they focus too much on talking. 

It's all about interviews and talking, and what happens when you hire only using talking? You end up hiring the talkers. 

You hire people who are great at selling themselves, but that's not who you want. You want people who are great at actually doing the job and getting stuff done. 

That's what this post is about—how to set up a hiring process that finds doers, not talkers.

## What I do to simulate real work

The most important thing when hiring is to simulate the work experience. You want to test for everything that goes into doing the job well. This is not just about finding good candidates—it's also about starting the onboarding process early so new hires can hit the ground running.

Forget long interviews full of talking. Instead, give candidates tasks that match real work. You'll quickly see if they're capable. Plus, they'll get a better sense of what working with you is like.


## By blueprint for hiring doers

I let every hiring process be unique and let it follow its own flow but i always start out with this blueprint.


### Step 1: How I write job posts that stand out

A job post shouldn't just list skills and experience. Instead, focus on what's in it for the candidate. What does everyday work look like? What are your rhythms and values? You want to attract people who are excited about how you work, not just those who meet the requirements.

Also, add something to filter out generic applications. Ask for something simple, like "Give us three reasons why you want to work here." This shows if they've done their homework and really care.

### Step 2: Test your **work chemestry**

Once you have some good candidates, start with a quick 10-20 minute call. I call this a virtual coffee. It's not about what you talk about but about how it feels. Do you have good work chemistry? Is this someone you'd enjoy working with? If not, don't waste time.

### Step 3: My approach to work tasks

The main part of your hiring process should always be a task that simulates real work. This task should:

 - Be something they'd actually do on the job.
 - Test key skills.
 - Act as a light onboarding experience.

For example, have developers build something small. Ask sales candidates to record a pitch. Have marketers create a sample campaign. The task should be simple enough that it doesn't take more than two hours for the right candidate. This shows not just their skills but also how proactive they are.

### Step 4: What I look for in the deep interview

After the work task, it's time for a deep interview. By now, you know they can do the job, and you've got a good vibe. This interview is about digging deeper and confirming your impressions.

Focus on why they made certain decisions:

 - *Why* did they choose a particular solution?
 - *Why* did they switch jobs?
 - *Why* did they take on certain projects?

Keep asking "why." You want to know if their reasoning aligns with how you think.

### Step 5: How I check references

The best way to check references is to ask the candidate what each manager from their last three jobs would say about them. This tests their self-awareness. Then, ask if you can call those managers.

You're going to be their next manager. So, whatever patterns their previous managers mention, you're likely to see too. People rarely change drastically.


## My key takeaway: find doers, not talkers

Don't waste time hiring people who are just good at talking. Build your process around tasks and real work. This way, you'll find candidates who are ready to do the job and fit right into your team.

If you want doers, change how you hire.
