Instead, it means: 1. Understanding the nuances of your team's challenges 2. Recognizing individual strengths and growth areas 3. Identifying small improvements that can have big impacts 4. Setting clear expectations at all levels</p> <h2 id=making-it-personal >Making It Personal</h2> <p>I recently observed a CEO who knew not just the names of his employees, but also remembered their children's ages and hobbies.
